# Programming Portfolio: Week 3

This folder contains *suggested solutions* to the programming exercises for this week. There are always many ways
to solve a problem, so many other correct solutions exist. There may well be others in the folders for individual
labs.

* `hello_stranger.py` is a version of the canonical second program. with a twist.
* `password_1.py` prompts for two passwords, and checks that they are the same.
* `password_2.py` requires that the passwords are between 8 and 12 characters long.
* `password_3.py` forbids certain common passwords, from a list.
* `password_4.py` repeats the process until the user enters a satisfactory password, twice.
* `seven_times.py` displays the Seven Times Table.
* `times_table.py` can display *any* times table, within reason.
* `times_table_2.py` displays the times table in reverse if the chosen number is negative.

Some of these programs do use techniques not covered in the practicals yet, notably exceptions.
