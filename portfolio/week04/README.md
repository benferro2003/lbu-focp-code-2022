# Programming Portfolio: Week 4

This folder contains *suggested solutions* to the programming exercises for this week. There are always many ways
to solve a problem, so many other correct solutions exist. There may well be others in the folders for individual
labs.

* `range_check.py` illustrates a simple use of a function to validate some input.
* `letter_count.py` counts upper- and lower-case letters in a string, and returns two values from a function (as a tuple).
* `hello_stranger.py` has a tiny addition to use a function to *capitalise* the user's name.
* `chomp.py` is a small function to emulate the Perl function of the same name, to remove the trailing character of a sequence.
* `temps.py` includes two functions to do simple temperature conversions.
* `temp_converter.py` uses two functions from the above programs (via an import) to convert C to F.
* `temp_stats.py` finds the max, min, and mean of six temperatures. Functions to read in and write out.
* `temp_stats_2.py` is the same program, but with input terminated on Enter. 

Some of these programs do use techniques not covered in the practicals yet, notably exceptions.

The code is provided "as is", with no warranty, implied or otherwise.
